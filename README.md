## Vision Statement
For Students, Teachers and Advisors who need a quick and easy way to visualize a students progress towards graduation. The GRAV system is a web based service that allows users to view in one screen at a glance what requirements have been fulfilled and what requirements still need work. 

Unlike Temples current system (DARS), GRAV will be much more streamlined visually and consolidated to the most basic information needed to see general progress. Only if the user wants, will more details be displayed. 
Our product provides a simple and intuitive way to know what you need to do to graduate. 

## Personas

1. Corey Vanderis sophomore CIS major at temple univeristy, he is 19 years old. He was born in Mt. Airy in Philadelphia and went to Central Highschool. On the weekends he works as a busboy at a bar in Center city. He is taking intro to programming, Physics II , English II and calculus. Corey is interested in web development and has some experience with writing simple server side code as well as client side code.

He has been frustrated with Dars as it can sometimes feel cumbersome and takes time to visually parse. As a user with a busy schedule and limited time he wants to be able to quickly get a sense for what courses he may need to take, and how many more requirements he may need to fulfill in order to graduate.
